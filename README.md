# halloween_2019
Just a fun home automation to use a Raspberry Pi connected to a motion detector, webcam, servo, and LEDs to start recording video when a motion detector is triggered, turn on LED "eyes" and turn a mannequin head with a Halloween mask on to follow a person's movement.   The videos will be broadcast on fb live.

# sewerlib is the library of functions to be used for the automation
# test import function from other file
